## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- Bootstrap 5 (grid system and utilities)  
- CSS custom properties (variables)  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- Flexbox and CSS Grid  
- Accessibility best practices (focus states, skip link)

---

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce the importance of structuring layouts semantically while combining a CSS framework with custom styles effectively.

Key takeaways:

- How to use **Bootstrap only where it adds value**, keeping custom CSS clean and minimal  
- How **CSS variables** greatly improve maintainability and visual consistency  
- How spacing, typography scale, and subtle hover/focus states dramatically improve perceived quality  
- The importance of matching assets and breakpoints precisely to achieve a pixel-accurate responsive design  

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve performance scores by optimizing images and auditing Lighthouse metrics  
- Continue refining accessibility practices, especially keyboard navigation and ARIA usage  
- Explore CSS container queries to further enhance responsiveness
